# Loopig - seaquence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
# looping is used to iterate over the range of number, text array elements, hash elements and so on.

# printing "hello world 10 times"

# For loop
# for i in 1..10

#         puts "The value of i is #{i}"

# find even numbers in 0..10
# for i in 0..10
#     if i%2 == 0 then
#         puts "#{i} is an even number"
